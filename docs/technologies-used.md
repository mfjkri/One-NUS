# ✨ Future Considerations

1. Better integration between `Redux` and `React Query` to improve app performance and code quality.

2. If I had to redo this project I would use [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) as my chosen UI component library as they have a huge library of beautiful [ready-made components](https://ant.design/components/overview) for use which would have sped up my development cycle.

3. I would also like to manage my app themeing a little better which in turn would allow me to give users a wider option of their preferred themes and color options.
